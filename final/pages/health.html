                  <h2>How walking 10k steps a day helps your health</h2></br>
                  <p>
                     Cardiovascular training improves your heart and lung health, which lowers your risks of several
                     diseases and all-cause mortality. Walking is a form of cardiovascular training that improves how
                     your body uses oxygen. With consistent walking, you will notice the effort seems easier, and you
                     can go for longer periods of time or at a higher intensity without feeling as winded. Some people
                     can even train themselves to work while walking on a treadmill desk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Walking, especially at a brisk pace, can reduce risks of cardiovascular disease, help you achieve
                     and maintain a healthy weight, and reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure, according to
                     research. As your aerobic capacity improves, your body uses oxygen more efficiently, which means
                     your heart remains strong and your arteries stay clear.
                     <br>
                     Daily walking can lead to a more positive mood and boost overall mental health.
                     <br>
                     For people with depression, anxiety, and stress, walking is an excellent way to support healing,
                     along with advice and treatment from a medical professional.
                     <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Walking has been shown to help reduce symptoms of depression with outdoor walking, especially in
                     green or blue spaces, providing an even greater impact. Moreover, increasing your exposure to
                     sunlight can help ease depression in many people, including those with Seasonal Affective Disorder
                     (SAD).

                  <p>
                     Walking each day lowers stress and anxiety levels, and the benefits extend past the time you are
                     actively walking.7 Generally, being active relieves symptoms of anxiety, and combining that with
                     time spent in nature creates a powerful effect. Research published in the International Journal of
                     Psychophysiology reveals walking for just a quarter-mile stroll at any pace in nature provides
                     impactful benefits for mental health, including lower stress and anxiety levels and improved
                     psychological state when compared to indoor exercise.8
